# DLD_Project
A lane changing obstacle avoidance game made for Digital Logic Design Project.
This project was done as part of the course **EE/CS 172/130 Digital Logic and Design** at **Habib University, Karachi**.

# File Descriptions
- clk_div works to control the frequency of clock running on Basys 3 Artix-7 and to provide the components their required clock frequency
- h_count and v_count work to iterate through pixels on screen horizontally and vertically
- keyboard is used to read keyboard input according to the clock frequency
- pixel_gen assigns the colors to pixels
- moveFSM controls out finite state machine

## Description
This is a Flappy Bird game coded in Hardware Description Language (HDL) `Verilog` for the `FPGA` board `Basys 3 Artix-7`.
